## David Harvey

I am a Software Engineer specializing in embedded artificial intelligence systems. My work focuses on developing high-performance, reliable solutions at the intersection of low-level programming and AI. With a strong foundation in mathematics-driven computer science, I primarily work in C++, Python, and Rust.

I have a background in business and finance and have contributed to consulting engagements at Amazon and Accenture, where I delivered analytics solutions and drove technical innovation in client projects.

My technical expertise spans Linux kernel development, microcontrollers, real-time operating systems, and modern web technologies including React and D3. I am also experienced in DevOps practices, particularly with Docker and GitHub Actions.

In 2024, my teams were recognized at the ETH Global Hackathon, receiving awards for the Most Innovative Application (*Net Zero*) and Best Use of On-Device AI (*AI Edge Drone*).

Feel free to connect with me to discuss embedded AI, systems programming, or scaling technology from prototype to production.
